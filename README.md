# Snakes!

A game developed with the only purpose of have some experience with the JavaScript language and also in client-server communication. Can be played with multiple players at the same time, each one in a client. Try it with multiple browser tabs!

It can be seen running on a VPS Linux server here: [http://dfontoura.vps-kinghost.net](http://dfontoura.vps-kinghost.net)

Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io

The game is divided into the following parts:
    - Keyboard listener, on the client side
    - the business rules (game.js), which runs on the server side
    - screen renderer, responsible for the game animation. It runs on the client side
    - server, which obviously runs on the server and makes the communication with clients
    - index, which runs on the client side and communicates with the server

Hope you enjoy it!
